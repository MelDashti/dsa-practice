Problems involving binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversals.

## Common Patterns
- DFS (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)
- BFS (Level Order)
- Recursion
- BST Properties

## Problems
- [ ] Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- [ ] Validate Binary Search Tree
- [ ] Lowest Common Ancestor
- [ ] Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
- [ ] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
